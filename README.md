# Netlify Provider for OAuth 2 Client

This package provides [Netlify API](https://docs.netlify.com/api/get-started/) OAuth 2 support for the PHP League's [OAuth 2 Client](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/).

## Usage

Install using composer.

```
composer require putyourlightson/oauth2-netlify
```

Usage is the same as The League's [OAuth 2 client](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/usage/), using `Putyourlightson\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Netlify` as the provider.
